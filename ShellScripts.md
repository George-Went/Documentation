# Shell Scripts 

## What is a shell 
A shell provides a interface/environment to the unix system.
It gathers inputted data ( usually in the form of a command line) and excecutes the program based on the inputs

The most commonly used shell in unix systems is BASH (Bourne Shell), if you use a terminal to interact with a linux system you will have used bash. All bash commands start with `$`.

when you enter in a command to linux such as `ls` you are executing a single line bash script to interact with the unix operating system (the `$` is automatically added at the start in the terminal).
