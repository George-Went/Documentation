## Introduction
Leota Xavier was the most despised lady in the town of Dreary Hollow. With a sharp tongue and scowls galore, this spinster managed to make more enemies than friends during her miserable lifetime. A five-time widow with more money than good sense, she retired as the headmistress at Dark Harbor Preparatory School a few years ago. She lived alone in a mansion on the outer edge of town with nine cats and terrorized the townsfolk when her butler drove her into town.

To nobodyâ€™s surprise, Leotaâ€™s body was discovered on her front steps early this morning. The Dreary Hollow Police have summoned you. You either have the missing pieces of the puzzle needed to solve the case, or you are a prime suspect.
This is where your story begins.

# JO REAPER (Louise Went)  
## Herpetologist
       
This herpetologist works at Princetown University in the Biology Department researching poisonous snake toxins. Jo Reaper is very sarcastic but sensitive. Jo is reliable, organized, and a bit compulsive. Jo will follow the rules and regulations and is practical. This snake researcher will pursue feelings and instincts â€“ especially where research is concerned. Jo was removed from the classroom at the university for being too blunt and rude to students. Jo despised teaching, so the going theory is that Jo did it on purpose as s/he wanted to free up time to devote to the lab to get more grant money. Always sniffling, Jo suffers from seasonal allergies, so this serpent handler is often moody and quiet.

> If you have anything snake print â€“ do that. If not, a lab coat is good or make a headpiece out of cardboard that looks like a snake. Rubber snakes as optional props.

# ELLIS ASHES (George)
## Gravedigger

Ellis Ashes took up with the family business of digging graves at Iron Gate Cemetery. A constant lip biter, Ellis was a former petty criminal.

Gracious, thoughtful, and caring, Ellis lives to please others and is an accomplished host. When Ellis walks into a room, the mood is lightened with Ellisâ€™s cheerful demeanor. Albeit, this cemetery worker can get restless, impulsive, and this causes Ellis to make poor decisions.

However, Rue has a vacant personality, lacking any hint of emotional flux. Orderly and structured, Rue is predictable, stubborn, and results-oriented. Known for an impeccable productivity record, Rue has great inner harmony and never exudes a rollercoaster of emotions. For that reason, Rue is a great mediator. A constant sweater, Rue is often seen wiping down with a towel and has a habit of picking at his/her teeth.
